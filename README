WebKit-EFL application for the W3C Network Service Description (NSD) API (http://www.w3.org/TR/discovery-api/).

This application is a browser that runs on top of a fork of WebKit implementing the NSD API (https://github.com/canonresearchfrance/webkit-nsd).
It allows demonstrating the use of the NSD API (https://github.com/canonresearchfrance/webkit-nsd-demo).
It also demonstrates a possible user interface of the NSD user granting process.

Note that this application is a fork of the Eve browser (https://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Eve).
In addition to NSD specific stuff, it also contains updates needed to Eun eve on the latest WebKit library.
